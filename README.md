# Machine Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my learning journey in Machine Learning and related topics!  
This repo contains hands-on notebooks, experiments, and resources as I explore and practice key concepts in ML.

## Repository Structure

- All content is organized as Jupyter Notebooks.
- Topics covered may include:
  - Fundamentals of Machine Learning
  - Data Preprocessing & Visualization
  - Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
  - Model Evaluation & Tuning
  - Explorations in Deep Learning

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OxxOrcus/machine-learning.git
   ```
2. **Open notebooks:**
   - Use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to run and explore the `.ipynb` files.

## Goals

- Track progress and share knowledge gained in ML.
- Build a portfolio of projects and experiments.
- Encourage collaborative learning and contributions.
